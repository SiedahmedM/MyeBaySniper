# eBay Production Access Verification Guide

## üîí Your Account Status
Your eBay developer account is currently **disabled for production**. This is normal for new developer accounts.

## üìã Steps to Enable Production Access

### 1. Complete eBay Developer Verification
- Go to your [eBay Developer Account](https://developer.ebay.com/my/account)
- Look for verification or account status section
- You may need to provide:
  - **Personal/Business Information**: Name, address, phone number
  - **Application Description**: Explain that you're building a personal auction sniping tool
  - **Use Case**: "Automated bidding tool for personal use to place bids in the final seconds of auctions"
  - **Expected API Call Volume**: "Low - under 5,000 calls per day"

### 2. Typical Verification Requirements
- Valid eBay account in good standing
- Verified email address
- Sometimes phone verification
- Agreement to eBay API License Agreement
- May take 24-48 hours for approval

### 3. What to Say in Your Application
If asked about your use case, here's a template:

```
Application Name: MyeBaySniper
Description: Personal auction management tool for automated bidding
Use Case: This application helps users manage their auction bidding by:
- Tracking multiple auctions
- Setting maximum bid amounts
- Automatically placing bids in the final seconds of auctions
- Preventing emotional overbidding
- Managing bid groups and strategies

This is for personal use only and will comply with all eBay policies.
Expected volume: Less than 5,000 API calls per day
APIs needed: Browse API, Bidding API
```

## üöÄ While You Wait for Approval

### Option 1: Continue Development in Sandbox (Recommended)
- The app is already switched back to sandbox mode
- You can test all features except real bidding
- Perfect for UI/UX development and testing

### Option 2: Prepare for Production
- Set up Vercel environment variables (ready for when you get credentials)
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Implement additional features

### Option 3: Create a Demo Video
- Record your app working in sandbox mode
- This can help with eBay approval if they need to see your application

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- **Don't mention "sniping"** in official communications with eBay (use "automated bidding" instead)
- Emphasize personal use, not commercial
- Be honest about the functionality
- eBay allows automated bidding tools as long as they follow their API terms

## üìû If Verification is Denied
1. Contact eBay Developer Support
2. Clarify that it's for personal use
3. Emphasize that it follows all eBay policies
4. Consider starting with read-only access first

## ‚úÖ Once Approved
1. You'll receive an email confirmation
2. Your production keys will be enabled
3. Follow the PRODUCTION_SETUP.md guide to configure everything
4. Start with cheap test items!
