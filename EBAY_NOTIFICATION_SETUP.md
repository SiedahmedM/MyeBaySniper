# eBay Marketplace Account Deletion Notification Setup

## üéØ Quick Solution to Enable Production Access

eBay requires all production API users to implement an endpoint that handles GDPR-compliant account deletion notifications. Here's how to set it up:

## Step 1: Deploy the Notification Endpoint

The endpoint is already created at:
```
https://myebaysniper.vercel.app/api/ebay/notifications
```

## Step 2: Configure in eBay Developer Dashboard

1. Go to [eBay Developer Dashboard](https://developer.ebay.com/my/account)
2. Look for "Marketplace Account Deletion" or "Compliance" section
3. You'll need to either:
   - **Option A**: Configure the notification endpoint
   - **Option B**: Apply for an exemption (if you're not storing user data)

## Step 3: Configure Notification Endpoint

When eBay asks for your endpoint details:

- **Notification URL**: `https://myebaysniper.vercel.app/api/ebay/notifications`
- **Verification Token**: eBay will provide this - save it!

## Step 4: Update Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local`:
```
EBAY_NOTIFICATION_TOKEN=<token_from_ebay>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://myebaysniper.vercel.app
```

Also add these to Vercel:
1. Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. Add both variables

## Step 5: Test the Endpoint

eBay will test your endpoint by sending a GET request with a challenge code. Test it locally:

```bash
# Test the challenge response
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/ebay/notifications?challenge_code=test123"
```

You should get a response like:
```json
{
  "challengeResponse": "some_hash_value"
}
```

## Alternative: Apply for Exemption

If you're not storing any user data (just using OAuth tokens temporarily), you might qualify for an exemption:

1. In the eBay Developer Dashboard, look for "Apply for Exemption"
2. Explain that your application:
   - Only stores OAuth tokens temporarily in browser session
   - Doesn't maintain a user database
   - Is for personal use only
   - Automatically "forgets" users when they disconnect

## üöÄ Quick Deploy Steps

1. **Deploy to Vercel First**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add eBay notification endpoint for production compliance"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Verify Deployment**:
   Visit: https://myebaysniper.vercel.app/api/ebay/notifications?challenge_code=test
   
   You should see a JSON response with a challengeResponse field.

3. **Submit to eBay**:
   - Go back to the eBay Developer Dashboard
   - Enter your notification URL
   - Complete the verification process

## üìù Sample Exemption Request Text

If applying for exemption:

```
Application: MyeBaySniper - Personal Auction Management Tool

Data Storage: 
- No persistent user data storage
- OAuth tokens stored only in browser session storage
- No database or backend user storage
- All user data cleared on logout/disconnect

Purpose: Personal use tool for managing auction bids
Users: Single user (myself)

Given that no user data is persistently stored and this is a personal-use application, I request exemption from the marketplace account deletion notification requirement.
```

## ‚úÖ Once Approved

After eBay verifies your endpoint or approves your exemption:
1. Your production keys will be enabled
2. Follow the PRODUCTION_SETUP.md guide
3. Start sniping with real auctions!
