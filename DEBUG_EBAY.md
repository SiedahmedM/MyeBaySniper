# eBay Notification Debug Guide

## If validation still fails after deployment:

### Option 1: Try without trailing slash
eBay might be picky about exact URL format. Try entering:
- `https://mye-bay-sniper.vercel.app/api/ebay/notifications` (no trailing slash)

### Option 2: Check Vercel Function Logs
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click on "Functions" tab
3. Look for `/api/ebay/notifications`
4. Check the logs to see what eBay is sending

### Option 3: Try different token
Sometimes special characters in tokens cause issues. Try a simpler token:
- Use: `ebaynotificationtoken2025`
- Update in both eBay form and Vercel env vars

### Option 4: Manual verification test
Try this exact format that matches the PHP example:
```bash
curl -X POST https://mye-bay-sniper.vercel.app/api/ebay/notifications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "challenge_code=test123"
```

### Option 5: Contact eBay Support
If none of the above work, you may need to:
1. Apply for exemption instead
2. Contact eBay Developer Support with:
   - Your endpoint URL
   - Screenshot of the error
   - Mention you've implemented the endpoint according to their docs
